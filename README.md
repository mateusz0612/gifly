## Reflection

This was a 2 days long side project for learning React (also React libraries) and improve JavaScript/HTML/CSS skills. 
During this project i learned how to use React hooks, React Router. I also used axios to make API requests.
I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
